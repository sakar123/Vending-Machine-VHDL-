# Vending-Machine-VHDL-
This project involves the design of Finite State Machines (FSM) to implement the following functionality:
1)    The vending machine is supposed to sell 3 items, item A for $1.75, B for 2.50 and C for $3.25. Active High input switches A_order, B_order, and C_order are to be used to simulate selecting an item.
2)    The vending machine will accept quarter coins, $1- and $5-Dollar bills only. Input switches (Active High) Quarter, Dollar and Five_Dollar are used to simulate the insertion of coins or bills.
3)    Reset input: (Active High) switch that is used to initialize the system, which includes that the vending machine has 10 pieces of each of the items A, B, and C.
4)    Cancel input: (Active High) switch that that it used when the user wants to cancel the transaction and get back the inserted coins.
5)    Seven Segment Display with be used to show the accumulated funds that were already inserted, and the amount of remaining change to be dispensed after each successful transaction or when the transaction is cancelled.
6)    Three LED output will indicate that item A, B, or C is being dispensed.
7)    Error messages to be displayed when the inserted funds are less that the price of selected item.
8)    Error message to be displayed when the machine has run out of any of the items.
